# Faucet-List
**A WordPress Plug-In to make a user-controlled link list.**

This would be a useful addition to the clickforcharity.net site, so that users can get the most out of faucets etc. Using a list site that is now gone, I found I could double the income for the time spent. It saves wasting time visiting sites that are not yet ready or forgetting to visit ones that are. Much more efficient.

*It’s a user filled list of sites with a timer set for each one.
*No need to remember which ones are ready, or having to keep lots of tabs open.
*Can set up a few with our reflinks to start with
*If users keep the page open that will get us more JSEcoin and TUBE. We can see which sites are most popular.
*Links will have clickforcharity in the http_referer header so sites will see they are getting traffic from us.
There is a page set up on the site using a custom plug-in. It will only work properly for logged-in users so I also need to find a way to make it only available to logged in users. Maybe the existing youzer plug-in can do that, I don’t want to install the Members plug-in just for that.
