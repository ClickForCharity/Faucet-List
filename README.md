# Faucet-List With Timers
**A WordPress Plug-In to make a user-controlled link list.**

This would be a useful addition to the [clickforcharity.net](https://clickforcharity.net/faucetlist) site, so that users can get the most out of faucets etc. Using a list site that is now gone, I found I could double the income for the time spent. It saves wasting time visiting sites that are not yet ready or forgetting to visit ones that are. Much more efficient.

* It’s a user filled list of sites with a timer set for each one.
* No need to remember which ones are ready, or having to keep lots of tabs open.
* Can set up a few with our reflinks to start with
* If users keep the page open that will get us more JSEcoin and TUBE. We can see which sites are most popular.
* Links will have clickforcharity in the http_referer header so sites will see they are getting traffic from us.

There is a page set up on the site using a custom plug-in. It will only work properly for logged-in users so I also need to find a way to make it only available to logged in users. I don’t want to install the Members plug-in just for that.

There is some more info including a to-do list at [nimno.net](https://nimno.net/sites/clickforcharity-net/faucet-list-with-timer/)
